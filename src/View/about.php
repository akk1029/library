                    <h2 >Story</h2>
                    <p class=visiontext>The three of us shared a deep passion for reading. We decided to create this website as a means to share our passion while helping people have easier access to books. The development process was long and arduious but in the end we managed to create a website that we were all proud of.</p>

                    <h2 >Achievements</h2>
                    <p class=visiontext>We are big supporters for children all around the world to have a right to education. We have raised over 100k thanks to the support of the community and was able to donate said money to schools in developing countries to help spread the joy of reading.We have partnered with some of the biggest publishers to run the Merit Scholarship Program (MSP) which offers scholarships to bright students in unfortunate situations.</p>

                    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
                    <p class=visiontext>Our goal in the long term is to grow our website and use said growth to give back to better the community. At the end of the day, the four of us just simply wish to spread the joy of reading with everybody.</p>
